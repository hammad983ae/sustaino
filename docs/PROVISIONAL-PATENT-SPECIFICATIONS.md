```typescript
// Core ESG Integration Algorithm
interface ESGValuationMethod {
  traditionalValue: number;
  esgFactors: {
    environmental: ESGEnvironmentalFactors;
    social: ESGSocialFactors;
    governance: ESGGovernanceFactors;
  };
  adjustmentCalculation: (traditional: number, esg: ESGScore) => number;
  confidenceScore: number;
  marketCorrelation: number;
}

// Novel ESG Weighting Algorithm
function calculateESGAdjustedValue(
  baseValue: number, 
  esgScore: ESGScore,
  propertyType: PropertyType
): ValuationResult {
  const weights = getPropertyTypeWeights(propertyType);
  const esgAdjustment = calculateESGMultiplier(esgScore, weights);
  const adjustedValue = baseValue * esgAdjustment;
  const confidence = calculateConfidenceScore(esgScore, baseValue);
  
  return {
    adjustedValue,
    confidence,
    methodology: "ESG-Integrated Valuation",
    adjustmentFactors: esgScore
  };
}
